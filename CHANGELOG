# 12/6/2024

- Added 2 new nodes
    - Because of the issues regarding backing up when the node is active, the node will have to go down when backing up.
    - This can cause the cluster to fail to at most 6 nodes, which is tolerant enough for most situations.
- Added new configurations to docker-compose.yaml to improve fault tolerance and availability
    - KAFKA_DEFAULT_REPLICATION_FACTOR - Sets the default replication for each topic
    - KAFKA_MIN_INSYNC_REPLICAS - Sets the default minimum in-sync replicas to commit a write
    - KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR - Sets the default replication for each topic partitions offset
