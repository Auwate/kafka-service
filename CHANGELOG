# 01/17/2024

- Added volumes back to the Docker Compose file
    - Was fixed due to strongly coupling Kafka placements to specific VMs
- Added sample consumers, producers, encoders, and classes

# 12/18/2024

- Fixed Docker Swarm bugs regarding connectivity

# 12/11/2024

- Added Docker Swarm capabilities
    - Specifically, the cluster will be split into 3 groups, where each node in the swarm will have a specific label
        - In deploy.placement, we specify group1, group2, and group3. If the VM with the label has it, they will be deployed there.
          otherwise, they will be placed into what is available.
- Moved requirements.txt to ansible directory
- Added 2 new brokers and removed 1 controller for a total of 9 containers
- Made all containers reference their respective counter-parts but with a "kafka_" prefix.
    - Due to how stacks work in Docker swarm

# 12/6/2024

- Added 2 new nodes
    - Because of the issues regarding backing up when the node is active, the node will have to go down when backing up.
    - This can cause the cluster to fail to at most 6 nodes, which is tolerant enough for most situations.
- Added new configurations to docker-compose.yaml to improve fault tolerance and availability
    - KAFKA_DEFAULT_REPLICATION_FACTOR - Sets the default replication for each topic
    - KAFKA_MIN_INSYNC_REPLICAS - Sets the default minimum in-sync replicas to commit a write
    - KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR - Sets the default replication for each topic partitions offset

# 12/5/2024

- Updated README with documentation
- Added CHANGELOG
- Finalized setup portion of setup_kafka playbook
- Added Kafka deployment to `setup_kafka` playbook 

# 12/4/2024

- Added Ansible support
- Fixed a bug where the broker containers reported they were wrongfully unhealthy
